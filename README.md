ManTIME
=======

Temporal expression extraction pipeline for general domain. System submitted to TempEval-3 challenge.

##Dependencies

You should have installed the following softwares:

* CRF++ 0.57 ([web page](http://crfpp.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/index.html))
* NLTK ([web page](http://nltk.org/))
* TreeTagger ([web page](http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/))
* MBSP CLIPS for Python ([web page](http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/software/mbsp-for-python)) [the code is commented]

##Installation

The easiest way to install ManTIME on Debian-based operating systems is by using the [install-mantime.sh](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~filannim/public/install-mantime.sh) script. Thanks to [Prof. Roberts](http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~angus/) (University of Sheffield) for it!

##How to use it

Put the .tml files in a particular folder and run the pipeline.py script.

    $ python pipeline.py <folder_path> [-pp]

the option -pp uses the post-processing pipeline on top of the CRFs model.

You can also annotate just a sentence using the following command:

    $ echo "<sentence>" | python annotate_sentence.py


The script will create a new folder in it, called "annotated", with the annotated .tml documents.
